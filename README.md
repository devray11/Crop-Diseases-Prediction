# Crop Diseases Prediction System

## AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection and Recommendation

This repository contains an AI-driven Crop Disease Detection System designed to assist farmers by providing fast and accurate identification of plant diseases from leaf images. Traditionally, farmers rely on manual inspection, which is often time-consuming, subjective, and prone to errors. This project addresses these challenges by leveraging Deep Learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to automatically analyze leaf images, classify diseases, and provide appropriate treatment recommendations.

This automated solution aims to mitigate agricultural losses, reduce the excessive use of harmful pesticides, and promote overall crop health by enabling early and accurate disease detection.

## Features

  * **Automated Disease Classification:** Utilizes a high-accuracy Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically identify and classify multiple crop diseases from leaf images.
  * **Real-Time Analysis:** Allows users to upload images of crop leaves through a web interface for instant disease identification.
  * **Treatment Recommendation System:** Provides users with practical guidance, treatment suggestions, and preventive measures based on the classified disease.
  * **High-Accuracy Model:** The AI model is trained on large, standardized datasets (like PlantVillage) to ensure high precision and reliability in its predictions.
  * **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and interactive web interface makes it easy for farmers and agricultural officers to upload images and receive results.

## Technologies Used

  * **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  * **Backend API:** FastAPI
  * **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras
  * **Data Processing:** NumPy, Matplotlib
  * **Core Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
